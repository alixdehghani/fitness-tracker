This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.4.

I Develope this project from [Angular (Full App) with Angular Material, Angularfire](https://www.udemy.com/angular-full-app-with-angular-material-angularfire-ngrx) Created by Academind by Maximilian Schwarzmüller.

I add some new features in this project: 
 1- add a new language (farsi) using [ngx-translate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngx-translate/core)
 2- adding some css styles in login & signup pages
 3- change some code to work with angular7 and rxjs
